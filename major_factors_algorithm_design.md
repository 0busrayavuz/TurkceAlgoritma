The major factors in algorithm design are:

- **Correctness**: An algorithm must be correct, meaning it produces the desired output for every possible input. It should solve the computational problem it claims to solve.

- **Efficiency**: The efficiency of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of resources it consumes, such as time and memory space. An efficient algorithm should solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time and use a reasonable amount of memory.

- **Modularity**: An algorithm should be designed in a modular way, with different parts of the algorithm clearly defined and separate from each other. This makes the algorithm easier to understand, code, and debug.

- **Maintainability**: An algorithm should be designed in a way that makes it easy to maintain and update in the future. This includes using clear and concise code, following coding conventions, and documenting the algorithm properly.

- **Functionality**: An algorithm should accurately and completely solve the problem it is designed for. It should handle all possible inputs and produce the correct output.

- **Robustness**: An algorithm should be able to handle unexpected inputs or situations without crashing or producing incorrect results. It should have error handling mechanisms in place to handle exceptions and edge cases.

- **User-friendliness**: An algorithm should be designed with the end user in mind. It should be easy to use and understand, with clear instructions and intuitive interfaces.

- **Programmer time**: An algorithm should be designed to minimize the time and effort required by the programmer to implement and maintain it. This includes using efficient and reusable code, following best practices, and using appropriate tools and libraries.

- **Simplicity**: An algorithm should be designed to be as simple as possible, while still solving the problem effectively. Complex algorithms can be harder to understand, implement, and maintain.

- **Extensibility**: An algorithm should be designed to be easily extended or modified to handle new requirements or changes in the problem domain. This includes using modular and flexible code structures.

- **Reliability**: An algorithm should be designed to be reliable, meaning it consistently produces the correct output for a given input. It should be thoroughly tested and validated to ensure its reliability.

These factors are important to consider when designing an algorithm to ensure that it is effective, efficient, and reliable in solving the intended problem.
